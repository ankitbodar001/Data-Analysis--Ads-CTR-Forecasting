# Data-Analysis--Ads-CTR-Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on Click-Through Rate (CTR) analysis and forecasting for online advertisements. CTR is a critical metric in digital marketing that measures the effectiveness of advertisements by calculating the ratio of users who clicked on a specific ad to the total number of users who viewed it.

Using Python, this project implements an end-to-end solution for analyzing past CTR data and predicting future trends. The approach involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
1. Data Preparation: Cleaning and processing CTR data to remove inconsistencies and handle missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and patterns in CTR behavior across various dimensions, such as ad placement and user demographics.
3. Predictive Modeling: Building a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression or decision trees) to forecast future CTR values.
4. Visualization: Generating interactive plots to showcase insights and predictions.

 ## Key Terms
1. CTR (Click-Through Rate): A ratio indicating how often users click on ads after viewing them.
Formula:
--  **ùê∂ùëáùëÖ** = (Number¬†of¬†Clicks / Number¬†of¬†Impressions) √ó 100

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Techniques to summarize main data characteristics using statistical and graphical methods.
3. Predictive Modeling: Using historical data to forecast future outcomes. Regression models are often applied for numerical predictions.

## Model used for Forecasting
1. ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average):
   ARIMA is a popular time series forecasting model used to analyze and predict future data points based on past trends. It consists of three components:
   
   Auto-Regressive (AR): Refers to the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations.
   Integrated (I): Involves differencing the data to achieve stationarity.
   Moving Average (MA): Models the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model.
   ARIMA assumes no seasonality in the data.

2. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):
   SARIMA extends ARIMA by adding seasonal components to account for repeating patterns at specific intervals. It incorporates:
   
   Seasonal Auto-Regressive (SAR): Seasonal lags in data.
   Seasonal Differencing (SD): Handles seasonality-induced non-stationarity.
   Seasonal Moving Average (SMA): Averages seasonal error terms.
   SARIMA is ideal for datasets with strong seasonal trends and cyclical patterns.

These models are critical for accurately forecasting in scenarios such as sales trends, ad CTR, or weather predictions. They are particularly effective when paired with diagnostic tools like ACF/PACF plots to identify parameters.
